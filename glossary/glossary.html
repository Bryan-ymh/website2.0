                the difference between the purchase price and the net sale price. </p>

                outstanding equity. </p>
              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Cash flow statement </strong>Cash flow statement is a summary of the cash
                receipts and payment of a company over an accounting period, which classifies the cash receipts (i.e.
                cash inflows) and cash payments (i.e. cash outflows) of the company into returns on investments and
                servicing of finance, taxation, operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. It
                reflects a company's liquidity and solvency and presents changes in cash position of the company during
                that accounting period. Cash flow statement eliminates the long-term provisions and other allocations

              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Commodity</strong>A basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with
                other commodities of the same type. For example, a barrel of oil is basically the same product,
                regardless of the producer. Whereas for electronics merchandise, the quality and features of a given
                product may be different depending on the producer. The sale and purchase of commodities are usually
                carried out through futures contracts on exchanges where quantity and minimum quality of the commodity
                being traded is standardized. </p>

              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Corporate bond</strong>A bond issued by a corporation, rather than by a
                government. The credit risk for a corporate bond is based on the repayment ability of the company
                (issuer).</p>
              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Coupon rate</strong>The yield the bond is paid on its issue date.</p>
              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Credit risk</strong>The risk that a bond issuer will default, meaning not
                repay principal or interest to the investor as promised. Credit risk is also known as “default risk.”

              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Current income</strong>An investment income earned from interest, dividends,

              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Current yield </strong>The current rate of return of an investment
                calculated by dividing its expected income payments by its current market price. </p>

                conditions of a loan. For example, when a corporation fails to pay a bond which has matured.</p>
              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Depreciation</strong>A decrease in the value of an investment.</p>
              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Dividend</strong>Payments made by a corporation to its shareholders from
                past and current earnings. The amount you receive is based on the amount of shares you own. </p>
              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Dividends Per Share (DPS)</strong>Dividends Per Share (DPS) = Dividends /
                Issued Common Shares</p>
              <p><strong class="colorgreen">Dollar-cost averaging</strong>Investing a fixed amount of money in a
                specific investment at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions or prices. More shares are
                purchased when prices are low and fewer shares are purchased when prices are high. In a fluctuating
                market, the average cost per share is generally lower than the average price per share.<br>
                Advantages:<br>
                1. No emotions attached - Dollar-cost average means investing mechanically by buying a certain dollar
                amount of your preferred investment disregarding of how the price swings. See it as an opportunity to
                acquire more shares at a lower cost. <br>
                2. Avoids bad timing - By investing periodically you, you would end up losing lesser money during a
                market downturn. On the other hand you might miss out investing at just the right time before the market
                turns bullish.
                Disadvantages: <br>
                1. Good pick or bad pick? - You will have to identify good investments anyway. If your choice turns out
                to be a bad pick, you will be investing steadily into a losing investment. <br>
                2. Less flexibility - By adapting this passive approach you will not be responding to the changing
                environment, therefore it does not allow dynamic portfolio management. <br>
